early this evening you dropped by 
               to lean against pillows & talk 
                              about needing. is autumn really 
a season of grieving? i want you 
               to tell me what you think. although, 
                              now, the lotus leaves will soon be 
over with, still new grown ones are 
               just the size of cents. the heat is 
                              tall, robust & not yet ready 
for the end of her. deep in the forest 
               at the foot of trees, a rabbit dies & 
in death feeds blue flies, their blue 
                              the joy of living earth — when 
they dry up, the autumn swells, flows in, 
               the courtyard stone becomes as cool 
                              as water resting underground, 
as cool as late sky to the touch. 
               as patterns cut from dark by eyelet 
                              curtains through which i scan streets 
for a face that’s not yours. tonight 
               all things come flying in fast & 
                              at once. the weight of fallen stars 
indents my roof, birds flock so thickly 
               they move clouds & now the galaxy 
                              is endless over me. & you, 
cross-legged in your corner of the night, 
               blowing (with a handheld fan) 
                              the fireflies around.
