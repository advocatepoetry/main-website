In my dream the dead have arrived 
as escorts. We travel 

past cold hills and wolves 
wild in a deadlocked field. A corporation 

of stars cracks overhead. I lean 
my hand where the hunting dogs 

chase the rabbit, and they tell me 
constellation means assembled 

for life. Then they lend me 
a shovel and dissolve into night. 

There is no other way back. I dig 
through snow until the cold metal strikes.
