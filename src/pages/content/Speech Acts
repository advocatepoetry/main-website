The philosophers say there are words 
      that do things, make themselves
      real in the world,
so that when you said 
      *I promise,*
      you had to have meant it
and when together you said *I do* 
      the bond was real in every sense. 

Those are the examples, but there are others 
      like when I said *I’m queer*
      it did something – not to you
      (tho I guess a little bit to you)
      but to my world and my body
and when you first taught me the word 
            *woman*
            *man*
      that did something too. 

I think these words are the closest real thing 
      to prayer. To toss a stone across
      the frozen pond and see if it smash
      open or skip with grace and stop. 

But my voice will not hold my body.
And I don’t know if I can speak *transition* 
      or swallow it. 

Tell me, can I say 
      *I am?*
