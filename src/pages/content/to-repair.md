1.  

To repair,  
a sentence with two people in it.  

Tonight moonless pitch pines sweep their dark  
shadows, *la lancha* moving across the lake  
blurs into a filament of light.  

Didn’t make love, made fish en papillote, moved wordlessly  
through the house, reminding myself to touch  
my lover tenderly, intentionally, like a hand rising  
in the dark to cup the head of a sleeping terrier.  

2.  

Before the window at night a reflection  

Before the window my reflexive reaction  

Before the window a report, in progress  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of someone living  

that these words cannot compose  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in only one language  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [worrier woman ex- pre- friend descendent]  
 
Human, descended from immigrants, native to  

How can one be native if both place and person  
are constantly moving?  

3.  

To displace, replace, replicate, repair.  
Place setting, place value, placebo, placenta.  
“Take a number,” i.e,  
but the slip reveals a letter. A letter from which alphabet?  

4.  

In other contexts, “repair to.”  

(From *repatriare,* or repatriate.)  

5.  

Standing still is a migration through hours,  
the trick to not sinking is to jump and never land— the body becomes  
a body of land, surrounded by time the flash flood of it.  

6.  

So a caress then, a touch, the way bodies  
can come together or tear each other apart.
